# wikipedia-language-game
Guess the language that is extracted directly from Wikipedia. The default languages are set to **Russian**, **Ukrainian**, **Belarusian**, **Bulgarian**, **Serbian**, **Macedonian**, **Kyrgyz**, **Tajik**, **Mongolian**, and **Kazakh**. You may change them locally with accordance to [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1).

This is a project that I worked on many years ago and I hope to make a significantly better version in the near future.
